# 2026-02-14 - kuberise.io 0.2.0

**kuberise.io 0.2.0 - Improved install UX: named flags and clearer docs**

We've shipped a simpler, less error-prone installation experience.

**What changed**

**Named flags instead of positional arguments**
The install script now uses `--context`, `--cluster`, `--repo`, `--revision`, `--domain`, and `--token` flags instead of positional arguments. No more memorizing the parameter order or looking up docs mid-invocation.

**Clearer prerequisites**
`cilium` and `yq` are now documented up front so you know exactly what to install before you start.

**Updated docs**
Each install parameter now has a description and default value in the docs, and the k3d local development flow is clarified so you can spin up a full platform locally with less friction.

Whether you're running a single cluster or managing multiple environments, 0.2.0 makes the first install smoother and every subsequent one more predictable.
