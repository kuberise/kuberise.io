**kuberise.io v0.1.0 -- Empowering teams with flexible configuration ownership**

We've shipped two major releases that make kuberise.io more robust, easier to use, and ready for real-world multi-team workflows.

**v0.0.8 -- Production-grade foundations**
Every design decision is now documented across 13 Architecture Decision Records, making it easy for new team members to understand the "why" behind the platform. We added JSON Schema validation to catch misconfigurations before they reach the cluster, automated sync retries to improve resilience, and team-based labels so platform engineers can control who sees and manages what.

**v0.1.0 -- Configuration ownership for developer teams**
This is the release where kuberise.io becomes truly multi-team ready. The biggest change: developer teams can now own their application configuration in their own Git repositories, separate from the platform repo. Platform engineers manage infrastructure, developers manage their apps -- each team works in their own repo with their own review process and pace of change.

We also simplified the developer experience. Values are now passed to Helm charts exactly as documented by their upstream maintainers -- no more wrapping or nesting. If you're reading the cert-manager or ingress-nginx docs, the values you see there work directly in kuberise.io. This makes onboarding faster and troubleshooting easier.

Components that need both an operator and custom configuration (like cert-manager, keycloak, and metallb) are now cleanly separated, giving you better failure isolation and the ability to update each piece independently.

Whether you're running a single cluster or managing multiple environments across clouds, kuberise.io now adapts to your team structure, not the other way around.
