## What is an IDP?

An Internal Developer Platform (IDP) is a set of tools and services that abstracts infrastructure complexity, allowing developers to deploy applications without deep knowledge of Kubernetes or cloud infrastructure.

## What is Kuberise.io?

Kuberise.io is a free, open-source IDP for Kubernetes. It provides pre-configured platform tools (observability, security, networking, CI/CD, etc.) that you can install with a single command. You fork the repository, enable the tools you need, and run the install script.

**Key principles:**

- **GitOps** — the Git repository is the single source of truth. ArgoCD keeps the cluster in sync with the code.
- **App-of-apps pattern** — one ArgoCD Application deploys all other ArgoCD Applications.
- **DRY configuration** — shared templates and defaults with per-cluster overrides. No duplication.
- **No lock-in** — all tools are popular open-source projects. You have full control.

## Prerequisites

Kuberise.io does not install Kubernetes itself. You need:

- A running Kubernetes cluster (minikube, KIND, k3d, or any cloud provider)
- CLI tools: `kubectl`, `helm`, `htpasswd`, `git`, `openssl`
- A GitHub account (or any Git hosting)

## What's Next

1. [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation) — fork, clone, and run the install script
2. [Folder Structure](/docs/getting-started/folder-structure) — understand the repository layout
3. [Enable/Disable Tools](/docs/getting-started/enable-disable-tools) — choose which tools to install
